# practice-henry-n
Hello my name is Henry! I'm so excited to start my college experience in this wonderful program! Not only do I hope to learn the foundations of programming, I also hope to meet many diverse groups of people and get to create new connections and bonds with them. I like watching TV, playing card games, play chess, and generally hang out with friends. I also like to play the piano.
Thanks!
